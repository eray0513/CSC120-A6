- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

I noticed that inheritance made my code way less redundant and faster to program. I wasn't balancing multiple methods that did the same thing and I was able to see how the classes intermingle and interact while still having their own function. What worked was reading the entire method description on the oracle class, not just guessing what it does. Also, talking to my classmates to get their opinions and ideas for solutions. What didn't work was attempting to do all the code at once and not taking any breaks. I would tell a future student to use oracle and go to office hours and talk to classmates to figure out difficult areas.
